# Surfs Up


## Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset of weather climate records from the SQLite database for June and December in Oahu, Hawaii to provide information to the investor to assess the sustainability of a surf'n'shake shop. The concern is that the weather may not remain favorable for customers to frequent the shop year-round. 

## Results

A weather analysis for the year from August 2016 to August 2017 includes data for temperatures and precipitation for Oahu, Hawaii. The precipitation data was first pulled, showing an average of 18% of the dates reporting precipitation. This determines that throughout the year, Oahu's weather remains relatively sunny. Next, temperature data was pulled for the months June and December regardless of the year, expanding the climate trend for this weather forecast.

- The temperature does not show significant fluctuations for either June or December.

- June trends as a warmer month with 75% of the days having temperatures above 73 degrees.

- December favors a temperature range of 70 degrees or higher, only 25% of the temperatures recorded were 69 degrees or less.

## Summary

The analysis supports that the weather for Oahu, Hawaii is likely to remain warm and sunny most of the year, providing favorable conditions year-round for the proposed surf'n'shake shop.

The average temperature trend for June and December is 71-74 degrees with a low chance of precipitation, which is very favorable for a surf and ice cream shop. Additional suggested queries to gather further weather data is a precipitation query for each of the months. The precipitation query for June compiles data from 2010 to 2016 with an average precipitation of less than half an inch. A similar precipitation query for December from 2010 to 2016 returns a similar observation.

Additionally, the analysis can be expanded to include March and September temperature data to provide a larger climate trend, looking at months closer to the seasonsâ€™ transition. Queries for these months equally support warm and sunny weather trends for Oahu.
