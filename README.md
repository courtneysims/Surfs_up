# Surfs up


## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset of temperature records from SQLite database for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii to provide information to the investor to assess the sustainability of a surf'n'shake shop. The concern is that weather may not remain favorable for customers to freqent the shop year-round. 

## Results

A weather analysis for the year from August 2016 to August 2017 includes data for temperatures and precipitation for Oahu, Haiwaii. The precipitation data was first pulled, showing an average of 18% of the dates reporting precipitation. This determines that thoughout the year, Oahu's weather remains sunny. Next, temperature data was pulled for the months June and December regardless of the year, expanding the climate trend for this weather forcast
